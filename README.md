# 🏦 Branch Performance Optimization & Location Analytics

## 📌 Problem Statement
Banks operate costly physical branches with varying performance. This project addresses the need for **data-driven decisions** on branch **closure, expansion, or optimization**.

## 🧠 Solution Overview
We apply geospatial and predictive analytics to determine branch viability across regions.

### 🔍 Core Components:
- **Geospatial Demographic Analysis**: Understanding location potential using population and competitor data.
- **Customer Foot Traffic Estimation**: Based on mobile app activity and ATM usage.
- **Profitability Insights**: Evaluating revenue vs cost for each branch.
- **Visual Dashboards**: Branch rankings, service demand, and closure recommendations.

## 📊 Data Sources
- Census datasets & demographic profiles  
- Competitor & internal branch coordinates  
- ATM transactions & mobile usage patterns  
- Real estate and local economic metrics  

## 💼 Business Outcomes
- Save 20–25% in operational costs  
- Enhance customer accessibility  
- Drive smarter network and resource planning  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas)  
- Power BI & Plotly for dashboards  
- Machine Learning (for foot traffic & ranking)  
- Public datasets and APIs
